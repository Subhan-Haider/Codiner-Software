# 🧠 AI Connectivity & Diagnostics: New Features Documentation

I have implemented a comprehensive **AI Diagnostics Suite** to ensure your workspace remains stable and your neural links are always operational. Below is a summary of the new documentation and features.

## 📄 New Documentation Files
- **[AI_DIAGNOSTICS_DOCUMENTATION.md](./AI_DIAGNOSTICS_DOCUMENTATION.md)**: Full technical guide on how the diagnostic engine works, including latency thresholds and capability detection.
- **Improved README Integration**: Updated system architecture notes to include the "Neural Pulse" layer.

## 🛠 Features Added & Documented

### 1. The Neural Pulse Monitor
Located in `Settings > Analytics`, this is your cockpit for AI health. It now tracks:
- **Real-time Latency**: See exactly how fast your AI is responding (measured in `ms`).
- **Capability Tags**: Know exactly what your model supports (Vision, Tools, AI Agents).

### 2. Auto-Verification Protocol
You no longer need to manually test your connection. The system:
- **Self-Heals**: Monitors connection health in the background.
- **Smart Triggers**: Tests automatically when you change your model configuration.
- **Persists Results**: Remembers your connectivity status even after an app restart.

### 3. "Plain English" Error System
No more confusing JSON dumps. If something breaks, the app now says:
- **"Your API is not working"**: Direct, actionable feedback.
- **Specific guidance**: Tells you if it's a quota issue, an invalid key, or a local server port conflict.

### 4. Node Telemetry Power
- **Individual Sync**: Test specific providers (like Ollama) without affecting your main chat.
- **Live Orbs**: Visual status indicators for every AI node in your cluster.

## ⚠️ Action Required
To see the latest telemetry UI and the new monitoring cards, please **refresh your view** or **restart the app**.
