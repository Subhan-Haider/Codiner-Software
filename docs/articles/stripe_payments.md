# Monetizing Your Vision: Stripe Integration Made Simple

![Fintech Checkout Mockup](stripe_fintech_ui_mockup)

Turning your code into a business requires a secure way to accept payments. Codiner integrates seamlessly with **Stripe**, the industry standard for online commerce, allowing you to go from "Idea" to "Invoice" in record time.

## Why Stripe?

Stripe handles the most difficult parts of running a business: PCI compliance, global currency conversion, sales tax calculation, and fraud prevention. 

## The Codiner Stripe Suite

We provide pre-built integration paths for the most common business models:

### 1. Simple Checkouts
Perfect for one-time product sales or digital downloads. You can generate a "Buy Now" button directly in your app.

### 2. Subscription Billing
Ideal for SaaS (Software as a Service) platforms. Manage recurring billing, trial periods, and tiered pricing plans with ease.

### 3. Customer Portal
Give your users the power to manage their own billing. Our integration includes a secure portal where users can update credit cards or cancel subscriptions.

## Getting Started

1. Get your **API Keys** from the Stripe Dashboard.
2. Link them in Codiner's **Settings > Integrations**.
3. Use our pre-built `PaymentButton` component in your app.

By handling the complexity of the "Checkout" flow, Codiner lets you focus on what really generates value: your app's core features. Start building your revenue stream today.
