# Scaling with Supabase: Your Cloud Database Solution

![Supabase Database Structure](supabase_database_visual_structure)

Building a dynamic application requires a place to store user data. Codiner provides built-in integration with **Supabase**, the open-source Firebase alternative, giving you a powerful PostgreSQL database with real-time capabilities.

## The Power of PostgreSQL

At the heart of Supabase is PostgreSQL, one of the world's most trusted relational databases. It allows you to build complex data relationships and scale to millions of users with confidence.

## What Codiner + Supabase Unlocks:

### 1. Unified Authentication
Easily add login and signup to your application using Supabase Auth. Your users can join via email, or social providers like Google and GitHub.

### 2. Real-time Database
Sync data across users in real-time. Whether you're building a chat app or a collaborative editor, Supabase push notifications keep everyone up to date instantly.

### 3. Secure File Storage
Upload images, videos, and documents with built-in storage buckets. Manage access permissions with Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure your users' data stays private.

## Simple Integration

To link your database:
1. Create a project at [Supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Copy your **Project URL** and **Anon Key**.
3. Paste them into the **Integrations** tab in Codiner.

Your app is now cloud-ready, scalable, and ready for production.
