![SEO and Localization Concept](global_localization_seo_concept)

Building a great app is only half the battle. The other half is ensuring people can find it. Codiner's **SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Engine** is built directly into our templates, helping you rank higher on Google without being an expert.

## SEO by Default

Most modern web frameworks require complex meta-tag management. In Codiner, SEO is a first-class citizen. 

### What's Built-in:
- **Dynamic Meta Tags**: Easily update titles, descriptions, and keywords for every page.
- **OpenGraph Support**: Optimized social sharing for Facebook, X (Twitter), and LinkedIn.
- **Sitemap Generation**: Automatically tell search engines about your site structure.
- **Canonical URLs**: Avoid duplicate content penalties by marking your primary pages.

## Real-time SEO Audits

Codiner’s dev tools include a real-time SEO auditor. As you build your page, the engine checks for:
- Missing Alt text on images.
- Improper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3).
- Mobile responsiveness issues.
- Page load speed bottlenecks.

## Why it Matters

Search engines prioritize sites that provide a high-quality user experience. By following the recommendations in the **SEO Analytics** panel, you're not just hacking a search engine—you're building a better, faster, and more accessible app for everyone.

Turn your project from a hidden gem into a search engine powerhouse.
