# Data-Driven Growth: A/B Testing in Codiner

![A/B Testing Analytics](ab_testing_data_analytics_graph)

Should your "Purchase" button be Red or Blue? Should your headline be "Start Building" or "Create Today"? Stop guessing and start knowing with Codiner’s **A/B Testing Engine**.

## What is A/B Testing?

A/B testing (or split testing) is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage to see which one performs better. By showing Version B to half your users and Version B to the other half, you can statistically prove which design leads to more signups or sales.

## Running Experiments in Codiner

Our templates include a lightweight A/B testing framework that allows you to define "Experiment Variants."

### Common Experiments:
- **Hero Headers**: Test which opening statement keeps users on your site longer.
- **Call-to-Action (CTA)**: Find the button color and text that generates the most clicks.
- **Page Layout**: Test if a single-column layout performs better than a multi-column one.

## Tracking Success

Codiner correlates your experiment variants with specific "Success Events" (like a button click or a page view).

1. **Define Variants**: Set up your two (or more) designs.
2. **Launch**: Codiner randomly distributes the designs to your users.
3. **Analyze**: View the **Analytics Dashboard** to see the conversion rate for each variant.

## Continuous Optimization

The best applications are never "finished." They are constantly being optimized. By using A/B testing as part of your regular development cycle, you ensure that every change you make is backed by real user data, not just intuition.
