## ⚡ How it Works: The Architecture

Codiner is built as a **Secure Desktop Hub**. It acts as the "Grand Central Station" between your code, your local AI models, and your cloud infrastructure.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/codiner-architecture.png" width="85%" alt="Codiner Architecture Diagram" style="border-radius: 10px; border: 1px solid #333;" />
</div>

### 1. The Core Engine (Electron + IPC)
Codiner runs as a multi-process Electron application. The **Renderer** (the UI you see) communicates with the **Main Process** via a secure **IPC (Inter-Process Communication) Bridge**.
- **Direct Filesystem Access**: Unlike web-based builders, Codiner manipulates your code directly on your disk.
- **SQLite Persistence**: All your project data and integration keys are locked in a local, lightning-fast database.

### 2. AI Orchestration
- **Neural Handshake**: Every request is verified against the provider's health before execution.
- **Atomicity**: Changes are staged and validated before being applied to your source files.

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security First

Codiner was born out of the need for **confidential AI development**. Your intellectual property should never be training data for a third party.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/security-privacy.png" width="80%" alt="Security & Privacy Visualization" style="border-radius: 10px;" />
</div>

- **Local Inference Support**: Deeply optimized for **Ollama**. Run Llama 3 or Codestral without an internet connection.
- **Zero-Data-Retention**: Codiner doesn't have a backend server. We don't track your code, your prompts, or your projects.
- **Encrypted Keys**: Your API keys for cloud providers are stored using industry-standard encryption, accessible only by the local Codiner process.
- **Audit Logs**: Every AI-driven file change is logged locally, so you can review exactly what was modified and when.

## 🏗️ The Template Foundry

Stop wasting hours on boilerplate. Codiner includes a curated gallery of **22+ verified, production-ready templates**.

<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/template-gallery.png" width="80%" alt="Template Gallery" style="border-radius: 10px;" />
</div>

### 🌐 Web Frameworks
- **React (Official)**: Next-gen React 19 template with Vite, Shadcn/UI, and built-in SEO audit tools.
- **Next.js 14**: Full-stack starter with App Router, server actions, and TypeScript.
- **Vue 3 & Svelte 5**: Modern reactive starters with Tailwind CSS and optimized build pipelines.
- **Qwik & SolidJS**: Focusing on maximum performance and minimal bundles.

### 📱 Mobile & Desktop
- **Universal Mobile**: React Native + Expo for iOS and Android deployment.
- **Native Desktop**: Tauri (Rust-based) and Electron starters for high-performance desktop apps.

### 🔌 Ready-to-Scale APIs
- **NextJS/NestJS**: Enterprise-grade backend architectures.
- **Hono/Fastify**: Lightweight, high-speed API foundations.

## 🏛️ Why Local-First AI?

The modern developer's greatest asset is their code. In an era where cloud AI models are trained on everything they ingest, **Privacy is not a luxury—it's a requirement.**

Codiner was built on three core pillars:
1.  **Sovereignty**: Your source code stays on your hardware. By default, Codiner prioritizes local inference models (like Llama 3) that run entirely without an internet connection.
2.  **Zero Latency**: Cloud-based AI builders are bottlenecked by network speeds. Codiner talks to your local filesystem and local AI instances at the speed of your internal bus (NVMe).
3.  **Extensibility**: Every project built with Codiner is **standard, clean code**. No proprietary lock-in, no hidden runtimes, and no "black-box" magic. Just pure industry-standard React, Vue, or TypeScript.

## 🧪 Advanced Use Cases

Codiner isn't just for building "Hello World" apps. It's engineered for professional software production:

### 💼 Enterprise Prototypes
Rapidly scaffold high-fidelity prototypes that use real production infrastructure (Supabase, Neon) without needing a dedicated DevOps team.

### 🛡️ Secure Finance & Health Apps
Build applications that handle sensitive PII (Personally Identifiable Information) with the peace of mind that no code context is being leaked to external servers.

### 🎓 Educational Lab
Experiment with different AI models (Claude vs. GPT vs. Llama) to see how they handle the same codebase, right inside the integrated "Neural Pulse" monitor.

---

## 🏗️ Technical Deep-Dive

### The File System Guard
Whenever the AI suggests a file change, Codiner doesn't just "overwrite" the file. It uses a **Transactional File System** approach:
- **Shadow Staging**: The new code is written to a temporary memory buffer.
- **Syntactic Validation**: The buffer is checked for basic syntax errors to prevent breaking your build.
- **Diff Comparison**: Only the necessary lines are updated, preserving your manual comments and specific formatting.

### The AI Routing Engine
Codiner's internal agent can intelligently decide which model to use based on the task:
- **Fast Mode**: Uses lightweight local models for repetitive boilerplate tasks.
- **Reasoning Mode**: Swaps to high-reasoning cloud models (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for complex architectural refactoring.
