# Privacy Policy

Codiner does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All processing happens locally in your desktop environment. 

## Local Processing
Everything you do in Codiner—from prompts to source code modifications—stays on your local machine.

## AI Data Handling
If you use cloud AI providers (like OpenAI or Anthropic), your data is sent to them strictly for the purpose of fulfilling your request. If you use local models (like Ollama), your data never leaves your machine.

## No Tracking
We do not use any telemetry or tracking scripts within the application.
